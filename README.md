# CTF writeups 


I like to participate in "Capture The Flag" events. For upcoming events see [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/).
  
Some permanent CTF challenges I'd recommend are:  
-[OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/)  
-[SmashTheStack](http://smashthestack.org/)  
-[DareYourMind](http://www.dareyourmind.net/) (the one that got me hooked on CTFs way back when :) )  
-[WeChall](http://www.wechall.net/) (aggregates scores from various permanent CTF challenge sites)

#### HackVent 2014

A great advent-calender style CTF run by [Hacking-Lab](https://www.hacking-lab.com/). 
Every day in December (until Christmas) a new challenge would open, each a little more difficult than the previous, 
and the goal each day was to find the flag, usually in the form a Christmas bauble with a QR code inside it.

Solving a challenge on the day of release got you max points, solving it later got you reduced points. 

This was a really fun event, had something for all skill levels and a variety of topics. Hope to see another event 
from them at easter!

Merry Christmas and a Happy 2015!
