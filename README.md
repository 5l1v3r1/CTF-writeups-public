# CTF writeups 


I like to participate in *Capture The Flag* events; computer security/hacking competitions which generally consist of participants breaking, investigating, reverse engineering and doing anything they can think of to reach the end goal; the *flag*, which is usually a specific string of text. 

**Join Me!** I am always looking for team mates, so if you are interesting participating in one of these events and want to team up, please let me know :D

#### Hacky Easter 2016

On March 14th, another edition of [Hacking-Lab](https://www.hacking-lab.com)'s annual easter egg hunt CTF will take place. 

*They recently released a teaser challenge:*

![](writeupfiles/he2016teaser.png)

On March 14, the third Hacky Easter competition is going to start! 

In order to shorten the waiting time, we are providing a teaser challenge in advance. Download the [presentation](HackyEaster_2016/writeupfiles/HackyEaster2016.odp) about Hacky Easter 2016. It shows information about the upcoming event, and gives a glimpse at the event's challenges. 

An easter egg is hidden somewhere in the file. Can you find it? You'll need to find hidden content in the file, and perform some operations on it, in order to get the egg.

GOAL:

1. Find the hidden content in the presentation.
2. Perform the necessary operations on it. You don't need to be a super h4XOR for this!
3. HINT: When extracting things from the presentation, do it from the original file, and not from within PowerPoint!
4. Get the easter egg
5. Submit the solution code which is written on the easter egg. Writing a solution document / hacking journal, is optional for this case.

The presentation file: [HackyEaster2016.odp](HackyEaster_2016/writeupfiles/HackyEaster2016.odp)


(will post writeups after the event is over)

#### HackVent 2014

A great advent-calender style CTF run by [Hacking-Lab](https://www.hacking-lab.com/). 
Every day in December (until Christmas) a new challenge would open, each a little more difficult than the previous, 
and the goal each day was to find the flag, usually in the form a Christmas bauble with a QR code inside it.

Solving a challenge on the day of release got you max points, solving it later got you reduced points. 

This was a really fun event, had something for all skill levels and a variety of topics. Hope to see another event 
from them at easter!

Merry Christmas and a Happy 2015!


#### Advent Calendar CTF 2014

A challenge for each day of advent
